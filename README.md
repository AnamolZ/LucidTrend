## ⚙️ How It Works (Conceptually)

At its core, LucidTrend runs an orchestrator that coordinates different AI agents:
- **Retrieval agents** → pull in the freshest news and data.
- **Summarization agents** → condense information without losing nuance.
- **Analysis agents** → connect stories, highlight trends, and surface insights.

This orchestration allows LucidTrend to act like a newsroom powered by AI — each agent playing a role, but the orchestrator ensuring they work together seamlessly.
